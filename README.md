# HealthSqyre Fullstack Coding Challenge
This repo exists to hold the coding challenge requirements for potential candidates.

## Getting Started
This repo contains a `test.html` file with the specific requirements for the challenge.
It also contains a `data.const.js` file that holds the data objects for this challenge.
Feel free to fork this repo or pull down the files to your local, but do not push directly to this repo.

## The Challenge
You will build a simple shopping cart application that includes, on the front-end, a product list and a shopping cart and, on the back-end, an API that includes a small set of common e-commerce endpoints. Frameworks are optional and of your choosing. (We like to use Python and VueJS here, as well as Ruby.)

## Requirements
- [ ] **REQUIREMENT 1:** On their first interaction, an end user should see the list of items from the test product list. 
- [ ] **REQUIREMENT 2:** From here, the user should be able to:
    - Add individual items to the cart.
    - View their Cart (which will start with no items)
- [ ] **REQUIREMENT 3:** From the Cart  user should be able to:
    - View all added items, including name & pricing 
    - View the total price across all items  

Note: If changes are made to the cart, price totals should be updated. 

Please provide us with documentation and an easy way to start this application.

## Considerations
- There should be a server-side and client-side component to this project.
- This should be a very basic cart implementation.
- Writing tests are encouraged.
- It’s okay to cut corners and “hardcode” things, just be prepared to answer questions about this in a follow up discussion .


### BONUS
**BONUS**: Add ability for user to update item quantities in the cart

**BONUS**: Add ability for user to remove an item from the cart
