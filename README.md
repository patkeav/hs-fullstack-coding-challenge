# HealthSqyre Fullstack Coding Challenge
This repo exists to hold the coding challenge requirements for potential candidates.

## Getting Started
This repo contains a `test.html` file with the specific requirements for the challenge.
It also contains a `data.const.js` file that holds the data objects for this challenge.
Feel free to fork this repo or pull down the files to your local. 

## The Challenge
Using whatever method you wish (_We're big fans of Vue.js, Python, and Ruby here, but you are free to use another language or library, keep in mind this position is heavy on the frontend_), write a component that gets the information from the data file and displays it in an HTML template.

## Requirements
- [ ] **REQUIREMENT 1:** Get the data, display the names of each product in a list
- [ ] **REQUIREMENT 2:** Format each list item so that it shows the product name, vendor name, price, and description
- [ ] **REQUIREMENT 3:** Add a sort feature that allows a user to sort via price (e.g. lowest price to highest price)

### BONUS
**BONUS**: Sort the list based on price, lowest price first

**BONUS**: Make it look cool. Be creative!
