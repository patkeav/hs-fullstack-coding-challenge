/**
** Let's build a Catalog Page
**
** As part of this test, you are given a data file containing a list of products
**
** Using whatever method you wish (We're big fans of Vue.js, Python, and Ruby here, but you are free to use another language or library, keep in mind this position is heavy on the frontend), write a component that gets the information from the data file and displays it in an HTML template.
**
** REQUIREMENT 1: Get the data, display the names of each product in a list
** REQUIREMENT 2: Format each list item so that it shows the product name, vendor name, price, and description
** REQUIREMENT 3: Sort the list so that vendors with the lowest id appear first, highest id appear last
** BONUS: Sort the list based on price, lowest price first
** BONUS: Make it look cool. Be creative!
